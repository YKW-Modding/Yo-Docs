# data/nx

This directory tends to have textures used in various places throughout the game, but another thing of note is the name of the folder itself. Yo-kai Watch 4 is on multiple platforms, so while nx is what's shown for the Switch versions, the PS4 version will have this folder as ps4. (The full path would then be data/ps4 on that version of the game.)
