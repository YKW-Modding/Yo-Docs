# data

This is just the beginning of where everything is in the game, so there's not very much notworthy here except for one thing: cpk_list.cfg.bin. This file is essential for modders, so make sure to copy and paste an unedited version of it when using Viola to pack your mods. As for the file itself, it tells the game where to load various assets from.
